- **Found:** AI-generated descriptions for all 29 curriculums
- **Identified:** Description patterns that need replacement with source text

#### 3. Curriculum ID Mapping
- **Mapped:** 28 out of 29 curriculums to existing app page IDs
- **Missing Mapping:** Applied Abstract Language Curriculum (Page 27)
- **Verified:** All curriculum navigation paths in app structure

#### 4. Verification Documentation
- **Created:** `curriculum-verification-list.md`
- **Includes:** Complete checklist for all 29 curriculums
- **Format:** Source page ‚Üí App ID ‚Üí Current AI description ‚Üí Status

### üìÅ Files Created

- **Content:** 29 curriculum entries with source page references
- **Format:** Checklist with verification status tracking
- **Instructions:** Step-by-step process following CLAUDE.md requirements

### üîç Key Findings

#### AI-Generated Content Identified

- **Pattern:** All descriptions use generic therapy language
- **Examples:**
  - "Encourage individuals to engage, respond, and participate..."
  - "Support individuals who process language analytically..."
  - "Help individuals improve speech sound production..."

#### App Structure Analysis
- **Navigation:** Uses `showPage()` function with curriculum page IDs
- **Data Source:** Curriculum descriptions stored in `search-data.js`
- **Mapping:** Script.js contains curriculum ID to data key mappings

### üìä Verification Status

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Total Curriculums | 29 | Identified ‚úÖ |
| Source Pages Located | 29 | Complete ‚úÖ |
| App IDs Mapped | 28 | Mostly Complete ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Content Verified | 0 | Pending ‚ùå |
| AI Content Replaced | 0 | Pending ‚ùå |

### üö® Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Missing Curriculum Mapping
- **Issue:** Applied Abstract Language Curriculum (Page 27) not mapped to app ID

- **Risk:** Content does not match client specifications
- **Urgency:** High - affects accuracy of therapy planning tool

### üéØ Next Sprint Planning

2. **Process:** Read source ‚Üí Compare app ‚Üí Report differences ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify
3. **Requirement:** Wait for "continue" command between each curriculum
4. **Goal:** 100% content accuracy with source document

#### Required Workflow
- Work on ONE curriculum at a time
- Quote exact text from both source and app
- Report specific differences found
- Wait for "continue" before proceeding
- Never rush through multiple pages

### üîß Technical Implementation Notes

#### Files to Edit During Verification
- **Primary:** `search-data.js` (curriculum descriptions)
- **Secondary:** Check if descriptions appear elsewhere
- **Testing:** Verify changes appear correctly in app

#### Verification Format Required
```
