# Page 23 - Following Directions

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping children understand and follow simple 1- and 2-step directions using familiar language and structured tasks.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given visual and verbal cues, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will follow 1- and 2-step directions containing basic spatial and action concepts (e.g., "Put the block in the box, then clap your hands") with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, children work on following longer, more complex directions that require increased attention, memory, and language processing.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given verbal instructions without visual supports, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will follow multi-step and non-routine directions (e.g., "Before you color the picture, put your name at the top and fold the paper in half") with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, the focus shifts to following multi-step directions in real-world situations, such as classroom tasks, academic instructions, and daily routines. These directions often require listening, problem-solving, and carrying out multiple steps independently.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given verbal instructions in a natural setting, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will follow multi-step directions related to classroom activities and real-life tasks (e.g., "Get your notebook, write the date at the top, and copy the first sentence from the board") with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

# Page 24 - Asking and Answering Questions

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping children understand and respond to basic yes/no and wh- questions in structured tasks. Many children need explicit instruction to grasp the meaning of different question types, so this stage introduces one question type at a time (e.g., starting with “where” questions before moving to “who” or “what” questions).

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given structured tasks focusing on one question type at a time, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately answer yes/no and wh- questions (who, what, where, when, why, how, which) with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, therapy focuses on helping children understand, answer, and ask a mix of yes/no and wh- questions naturally within conversations. At this stage, children move beyond structured practice with single question types and begin responding to a variety of questions in real-time interactions.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, during a 15-minute conversation with the therapist, \_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately answer and ask a variety of yes/no and wh- questions at least 10 times across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, therapy focuses on helping children use questions independently in real-world settings, such as classroom activities, social interactions, and problem-solving situations. Children practice answering complex, multi-step questions in academic settings while also learning to initiate and use questions to navigate social and functional situations.

**Goal:** [No Sample Goal - therapy becomes customized to specific question skills]

# Page 25 - Sequencing

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping children sequence and retell simple, familiar routines and tasks in the correct order.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given visual or verbal prompts, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately sequence and verbally retell the steps of a familiar task (e.g., brushing teeth, making a sandwich) in the correct order using transition words (first, next, last) in 80% of opportunities across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, therapy focuses on helping children retell past events in a clear, logical order. Many children who struggle with this skill may jump around in their story, leave out important details, or assume the listener already knows what happened. During this stage, children learn to provide context, include key details, and organize their thoughts using sequencing words (e.g., first, then, last).

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given visual or verbal prompts, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately retell a past event (e.g., what they did over the weekend) using a clear beginning, middle, and end, while providing necessary details and sequencing words (first, then, last) in 80% of opportunities across three consecutive sessions.

---

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, therapy focuses on applying sequencing and retelling skills to academic tasks, such as summarizing a story, explaining a classroom activity, or organizing thoughts for written assignments.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given verbal or written prompts, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately retell a narrative or academic event (e.g., summarizing a story, explaining a science experiment) using a clear structure, appropriate sequencing, and temporal concepts (e.g., before, during, after) in 80% of opportunities across three consecutive sessions.
