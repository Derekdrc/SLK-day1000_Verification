# Page 19 - Phonology

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, we focus on phonological processes that have the most significant impact on speech intelligibility and are typically eliminated first in development. These processes involve omitting entire sounds or syllables, making speech difficult to understand.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will eliminate initial consonant deletion, final consonant deletion, and unstressed syllable deletion in conversational speech, producing complete words with all expected sounds (sound substitutions are acceptable as long as all sounds are represented) with fewer than 5 errors in 10 minutes of conversation, as measured by clinician observation and data collection.

**Activities:**

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, we target phonological processes that involve replacing or simplifying more complex sounds, which can still significantly impact intelligibility.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will eliminate velar fronting, backing, stopping of fricatives, and cluster reduction in conversational speech with fewer than 5 errors in 10 minutes of conversation, as measured by clinician observation and data collection.

**Activities:**

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, we focus on phonological processes that persist longer in development and are harder to perceive and therefore teach in therapy.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will eliminate gliding of liquids, prevocalic voicing, and postvocalic devoicing in conversational speech with fewer than 5 errors in 10 minutes of conversation, as measured by clinician observation and data collection.

# Page 20 - Motor Speech

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on building a strong foundation for speech by developing consistent and accurate motor planning for simple word structures.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given multisensory cues and verbal models, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will accurately produce CV, VC, and CVC word structures at least 30 times within a 15-minute play-based session in 80% of opportunities across three consecutive sessions.

**Activities:**

---

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, therapy focuses on increasing speech complexity and utterance length by introducing expanded word structures (e.g., CVCV, CCVC) and combining simple words into longer phrases. As children with motor speech disorders develop greater consistency with individual words, they must learn to transition smoothly between sounds and syllables while producing longer utterances.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, given verbal models and multisensory cues, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  will accurately produce expanded word structures (CVCV, CCVC) and/or combine CV, VC, and CVC words into two- to three-word utterances at least 30 times within a 15-minute play-based session across three consecutive sessions.

**Activities:**

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, therapy focuses on refining speech coordination, accuracy, and fluency in multi-syllabic words and connected speech. As speech complexity increases, children with motor speech disorders may struggle with smooth transitions between sounds and syllables, as well as maintaining consistent articulation and natural prosody.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will improve speech intelligibility and fluidity by achieving at least a 4 out of 5 on the following rubric, as measured by the classroom teacher.

# Page 21 - Mumbling

## Beginner Level

**Description:** At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping the child become aware of their speech clarity by practicing intentional overarticulation in structured activities. Many children who mumble are unaware that their speech is unclear, so this stage emphasizes exaggerating speech movements, slowing down, and fully pronouncing words to establish a foundation for clear communication. By using overarticulation in structured tasks, the child learns what clear speech feels and sounds like, making it easier to carry over into everyday interactions.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will use intentional overarticulation (exaggerated speech clarity) when speaking single sentences when prompted during therapy on 80% of opportunities.

**Activities:**

---

## Intermediate Level

**Description:** At the Intermediate Level, the focus shifts from structured overarticulation in shorter speech tasks to using the strategy as needed in longer speaking opportunities. At this stage, the child practices speaking naturally but learns to adjust their clarity in response to cues from a listener, such as a verbal reminder or a visual signal. This helps them build self-awareness and control over their speech while still having external support.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Student will overarticulate (properly and precisely pronounce every sound) in conversation when he receives a visual signal from the therapist on 80% of opportunities.

**Activities:**

---

## Advanced Level

**Description:** At the Advanced Level, the focus is on independent self-monitoringâ€”helping the child recognize when their speech is unclear and correct it without external cues. By this stage, they have practiced overarticulation and responding to prompts, and now the goal is for them to naturally adjust their clarity in everyday conversations. Therapy at this level emphasizes real-time awareness, self-correction, and maintaining clear speech across different settings, ensuring that improved articulation and volume become a consistent habit in daily interactions.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, During ten minutes of unstructured conversation in a natural setting, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will achieve a score of 4 or higher on the intelligibility and breakdown repair rubric below, as rated by the speech-language pathologist, on three consecutive data collection days.
