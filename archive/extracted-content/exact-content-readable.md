### Beginner Level

**Title:** Beginner Level: Using AAC for Basic Communication

**Description:** At this stage, the focus is on introducing AAC as a reliable, consistent communication tool for expressing wants, needs, and ideas. Many early AAC users begin by imitating core vocabulary and learning to use their device to request items. However, true functional communication happens when a child can spontaneously use their AAC system in interactions.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, during 10-minutes of interaction with the therapist (who is modeling AAC use), \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will spontaneously use the AAC device to communicate a want, need, or idea at least \_\_\_ times.

**Activities:**

### Intermediate Level

**Title:** Intermediate Level: Expanding AAC Use to Different Communicative Functions

**Description:** At this stage, the child begins to use their AAC device or system for more than just requesting and expands their ability to communicate for a variety of reasons. Instead of only saying "I want," they learn to reject, describe, indicate location, and self-advocate, building a more functional and flexible communication system.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, during a 10-minute interaction with the therapist (who is modeling AAC use), \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will spontaneously use alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) or spoken speech to express at least \_(number)\_ different communicative intents (examples: rejection/cessation, recurrence, actions, attributes, possession, location, self-advocacy).

**Activities:**
- [Expanding Communication through AAC](#page-57:-expanding-communication-through-aac)

### Advanced Level

**Title:** Advanced Level: Using AAC for Independent Functional Communication

**Description:** At this level, the focus is on independent, flexible communication across settings. The individual should be able to use AAC to engage in conversations, advocate for themselves, and navigate real-world situations.

### Beginner Level

**Title:** Beginner Level: Early-Developing Sounds

**Description:** The sounds in this level are some of the first that children typically acquire as they learn to speak. They are produced with simple mouth movements and are foundational for clear communication. Mastering these early sounds helps build confidence and sets the stage for developing more complex speech patterns. Therapy at this level focuses on helping the child accurately produce these sounds in isolation, then gradually using them in syllables, words, and simple phrases.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will correctly produce early-developing speech sounds (/b, n, m, p, h, w, d/ and vowels) in structured conversational tasks (e.g., retelling a simple story or providing a short response to a question/prompt) with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

**Activities:**
- [/b/ Sound](#page-58:-/b/-sound)
- [/m/ Sound](#page-59:-/m/-sound)
- [/n/ Sound](#page-60:-/n/-sound)
- [/p/ Sound](#page-61:-/p/-sound)
- [/h/ Sound](#page-62:-/h/-sound)
- [/w/ Sound](#page-63:-/w/-sound)
- [/d/ Sound](#page-64:-/d/-sound)
- [Vowel Sounds](#page-65:-vowel-sounds)

### Intermediate Level

**Title:** Intermediate Level: Mid-Developing Sounds

**Description:** At this level, we focus on speech sounds that require more precise tongue and airflow coordination. These sounds typically emerge after the early-developing sounds but may still be challenging for some individuals.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will correctly produce mid-developing speech sounds (/ɡ, k, f, t, ŋ ("ng"), "y"/) in structured conversational tasks (e.g., retelling a simple story or providing a short response to a question/prompt) with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

**Activities:**
- [/k/ Sound](#page-66:-/k/-sound)
- [/g/ Sound](#page-67:-/g/-sound)
- [/f/ Sound](#page-68:-/f/-sound)
- [/t/ Sound](#page-69:-/t/-sound)
- [/ŋ/ “ng” Sound](#page-70:-/ŋ/-“ng”-sound)
- [“y” Sound](#page-71:-“y”-sound)

### Advanced Level

**Title:** Advanced Level: Later-Developing Sounds and Clusters

**Description:** At this level, therapy focuses on speech sounds that require precise tongue movements, airflow control, and coordination. These later-developing sounds are often the most challenging for children to master and may impact overall speech intelligibility if not produced correctly.

**Goal:** By the end of the reporting period, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will correctly produce later-developing speech sounds (/v, ʤ ("j"), s, ʧ ("ch"), l, ʃ ("sh"), z, /r/, “th” (voiced and voiceless), ʒ ("zh" as in "measure")/ and consonant clusters) in structured conversational tasks (e.g., retelling a simple story or providing a short response to a question/prompt) with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

**Activities:**
- [/v/ Sound](#page-72:-/v/-sound)
- [/ʤ/ ("j") Sound](#page-73:-/ʤ/-\("j"\)
- [/s/ Sound](#page-74:-/s/-sound)
- [/ʧ/ ("ch") Sound](#page-75:-/ʧ/-\("ch"\)
- [/l/ Sound](#page-76:-/l/-sound)
- [/ʃ/ ("sh") Sound](#page-77:-/ʃ/-\("sh"\)
- [/z/ Sound](#page-78:-/z/-sound)
- [/r/ Sound](#page-79:-/r/-sound)
- [“th” Sound (Voiced and Voiceless)](#page-80:-“th”-sound-\(voiced-and-voiceless\)
- [/ʒ/ Sound ("zh" as in "measure")](#page-81:-/ʒ/-sound-\("zh"-as-in-"measure"\)
- [Consonant Clusters (like /st/ and /tw/)](#page-82:-consonant-clusters-\(like-/st/-and-/tw/\)
