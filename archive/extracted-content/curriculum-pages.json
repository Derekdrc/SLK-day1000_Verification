Many children who struggle with communication may not yet respond to their name consistently or participate in shared activities. Therapy at this level uses play-based strategies to encourage engagement and increase responsiveness to social interactions.\n\n**Sample Goal:**   \nBy the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_ will improve social awareness and engagement skills by achieving at least a 4 out of 5 on the following rubric as evaluated by the (speech-language pathologist/teacher/parent) over the previous two weeks.\n\n| Score | Description |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| **5 – Emerging Mastery** | Consistently responds to name, actively shares attention during play (e.g., looks between object and adult, points/showing), and initiates or participates in turn-taking activities with minimal support. |\n| **4 – Strong Progress** | Responds to name in most settings; shares joint attention with adult support (e.g., follows gaze or pointing); participates in familiar turn-taking routines but may need reminders or prompts to stay engaged. |\n| **3 – Developing** | Inconsistently responds to name; shows some awareness of shared activities but rarely shifts attention between people and objects; may imitate turn-taking actions but needs frequent support to participate. |\n| **2 – Emerging Skills** | Rarely responds to name; joint attention is limited or absent (focuses only on object or person, not both); turn-taking occurs only with high levels of prompting and modeling. |\n| **1 – Limited/Not Yet Observed** | Does not respond to name; no observable joint attention; does not engage in or attempt turn-taking activities even with adult modeling. |\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, choose one or more of the suggested activities below. You can present them in any order and skip any activities the individual has already mastered. Focus on one skill at a time. You may either work on a single skill until it is mastered, or rotate through all the skills—spending a set amount of time on each (e.g., 2 weeks)—and revisit the ones that still need more practice.\n\nButton: [Responding to Name](#page-43:-responding-to-name)\t\t\tButton: [Joint Attention and Turn Taking](#page-44:-joint-attention-and-turn-taking)\n\n#### Intermediate Level: Understanding and Responding to Communication {#intermediate-level:-understanding-and-responding-to-communication}\n\nAt this stage, the child builds on their social engagement skills by learning to understand and respond to simple communication cues.

You may either work on a single skill until it is mastered, or rotate through all the skills—spending a set amount of time on each (e.g., 2 weeks)—and revisit the ones that still need more practice.\n\nButton: [Produce Expanded Word Structures, such as CVCV, CCVC, etc.](#page-93:-produce-expanded-word-structures,-such-as-cvcv,-ccvc,-etc.)\n\nButton: [Produce 2-Word Utterances](#page-53:-producing-2-word-utterances)  \n(Note: you will need to modify this activity slightly.  Focus on using shorter words that the child can approximate.  It's OK to simplify harder words down into a CV, VC or CVC structure.  For example, \"ball\" could be \"ba\" for now)\n\n#### Advanced Level: Coordination and Connected Speech {#advanced-level:-coordination-and-connected-speech}\n\nAt the Advanced Level, therapy focuses on refining speech coordination, accuracy, and fluency in multi-syllabic words and connected speech. As speech complexity increases, children with motor speech disorders may struggle with smooth transitions between sounds and syllables, as well as maintaining consistent articulation and natural prosody.\n\n**Sample Goal:**   \nBy the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will improve speech intelligibility and fluidity by achieving at least a 4 out of 5 on the following rubric, as measured by the classroom teacher.\n\n**Over the past few weeks, this individual's speech was...**\n\n1. **Very difficult to understand.** Speech is unclear, choppy, or broken up so much that listeners frequently ask for repetition or can’t understand the message.  \n2. **Often hard to understand.** Some words come out clearly, but speech frequently breaks down, and the child struggles to get words out smoothly. Listeners need to guess or ask for clarification.  \n3. **Mostly understandable, but not always smooth.** Speech is clearer, but some sounds or syllables are still missing, jumbled, or awkward. Occasional pauses or struggles are noticeable.  \n4. **Easily understood with only small disruptions.** Speech flows well, and most words sound natural. There may be minor pauses or small articulation errors, but they don’t interfere much with understanding.  \n5. **Natural and smooth.** The individual speaks clearly and easily, with smooth transitions and natural rhythm. Listeners understand without effort.\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, choose one or more of the suggested activities below.

Many children who mumble are unaware that their speech is unclear, so this stage emphasizes exaggerating speech movements, slowing down, and fully pronouncing words to establish a foundation for clear communication. By using overarticulation in structured tasks, the child learns what clear speech feels and sounds like, making it easier to carry over into everyday interactions.\n\n**Sample Goal:**   \nBy the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will use intentional overarticulation (exaggerated speech clarity) when speaking single sentences when prompted during therapy on 80% of opportunities.\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, use the suggested activities below:\n\nButton: [Overarticulation in Words, Phrases, and Sentences](#page-96:-overarticulation-in-words,-phrases,-and-sentences)\n\n#### Intermediate Level: Speaking Clearly in Structured Conversation {#intermediate-level:-speaking-clearly-in-structured-conversation}\n\nAt the Intermediate Level, the focus shifts from structured overarticulation in shorter speech tasks to using the strategy as needed in longer speaking opportunities. At this stage, the child practices speaking naturally but learns to adjust their clarity in response to cues from a listener, such as a verbal reminder or a visual signal. This helps them build self-awareness and control over their speech while still having external support.\n\n**Sample Goal:**   \nBy the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Student will overarticulate (properly and precisely pronounce every sound) in conversation when he receives a visual signal from the therapist on 80% of opportunities.\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, use the suggested activities below:\n\nButton: [Overarticulate in Structured Conversation when Prompted](#page-97:-overarticulate-in-structured-conversation-when-prompted)\n\n#### Advanced Level: Self-Correcting in Conversation {#advanced-level:-self-correcting-in-conversation}\n\nAt the Advanced Level, the focus is on independent self-monitoring—helping the child recognize when their speech is unclear and correct it without external cues. By this stage, they have practiced overarticulation and responding to prompts, and now the goal is for them to naturally adjust their clarity in everyday conversations. Therapy at this level emphasizes real-time awareness, self-correction, and maintaining clear speech across different settings, ensuring that improved articulation and volume become a consistent habit in daily interactions.\n\n**Sample Goal:**   \nBy the end of the reporting period, During ten minutes of unstructured conversation in a natural setting, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will achieve a score of 4 or higher on the intelligibility and breakdown repair rubric below, as rated by the speech-language pathologist, on three consecutive data collection days.\n\n5 \\= Almost everything the student said was easily understood.

When unclear, the student recognized signs of confusion (e.g., listener facial expression, request for repetition) and made effective attempts to clarify.\n\n3 \\= About half of the student’s speech was understood. The student occasionally attempted to clarify when prompted or when signs of confusion were obvious, but not consistently or effectively.\n\n2 \\= Less than half of the student’s speech was understood.

Written forms show developing organization but may lack clarity or full elaboration. |\n| **3 – Developing** | Demonstrates emerging use of multiple discourse structures in spoken language, though performance may be inconsistent or incomplete. Narratives may have basic structure but limited detail or clarity. Informational content may include isolated facts without a clear main idea or organized structure. Opinions may be stated without support. Attempts at written discourse are present but minimal or disorganized. |\n| **2 – Beginning** | Uses some discourse forms in spoken communication, but structure and clarity are limited. Narratives may be difficult to follow or missing key parts. Informational content may be vague or disconnected. Opinions may be expressed but without explanation. Written attempts are rare or lack recognizable structure. |\n| **1 – Emerging** | Shows minimal use or understanding of distinct discourse structures in either spoken or written form.

Each program targets all of the skills from the rubric above in a cyclical manner.  Many activities and skills are repeated across difficulty levels so don’t worry too much about which level to pick.  Choose the one that seems closest to their current ability level.  Keep in mind that older children and teens (in middle school and high school) will likely benefit from explicit instruction in these areas so the 5th grade program can still be used for older students.\n\nOnce you have finished one difficulty level, you can repeat it (if they need additional practice) or move up to the next grade level.\n\nButton: [Kindergarten (5-6 yrs)](#page-167:-kindergarten-\\(5-6-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n\nButton: [1st Grade (6-7 yrs)](#page-168:-1st-grade-\\(6-7-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n\nButton: [2nd Grade (7-8 yrs)](#page-169:-2nd-grade-\\(7-8-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n\nButton: [3rd Grade (8-9 yrs)](#page-170:-3rd-grade-\\(8-9-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n\nButton: [4th Grade (9-10 yrs)](#page-171:-4th-grade-\\(9-10-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n\nButton: [5th Grade (10-11+ yrs)](#page-172:-5th-grade-\\(10-11+-yrs\\)-language-cycles)\n"

That there was something wrong with them because their brains worked differently.\n\nWe now know that all brains work differently and there are many different \"normal\" ways of being\\!  And this is amazingly empowering\\!  But our neurodiverse populations still deserve to understand what's going on around them.\n\nSo now, we teach perspective-taking as a way to understand the world around us.  Not because we want kids to change and conform.  But because they will feel more safe, secure, and loved if they understand why others do the things they do.  And they can navigate social situations their own way. \n\n**Sample Goal:** \n\n\\*\\* For this skill, select one of the perspective-taking goals from the link below.

The Stuttering Therapy Curriculum provides a structured approach to supporting individuals who stutter by providing them with strategies to reduce moments of stuttering and help individuals move through those moments more easily.\n\nChoose the level below that best fits this individual’s current level.

    "rawContent": "### Page 42: Cluttering Curriculum {#page-42:-cluttering-curriculum}\n\n**Cluttering Curriculum**  \nCluttering is a fluency disorder where a person’s speech sounds fast, uneven, or jumbled, making it hard to follow. Individuals who clutter may speak in bursts, leave out sounds or parts of words, or have disorganized language. Unlike stuttering, cluttering is less about getting “stuck” on words and more about talking too quickly or in a way that feels rushed and unclear.\n\nOne simple way to distinguish cluttering from stuttering, is that individuals who clutter will sound more clear when they are asked to slow down.  Slowing down doesn’t usually help those who stutter as much.\n\nChoose the level below that best fits this individual’s current level.  You don’t necessarily need to start at the first level if they have advanced beyond it.\n\n**Beginner Level:**   \n**Specific Strategies for Slow, Clear Speech**  \n(Ages: 7 \\- 10 yrs and beyond)\n\n* Understanding Cluttering  \n* Learning and Practicing Specific Strategies for Slowing Rate and Increasing Intelligibility\n\nButton: [Choose Beginner Level](#beginner-level:-specific-strategies-for-slow,-clear-speech)  \n**Intermediate Level:**   \n**Increasing mastery of strategies**  \n(Ages: 9 \\- 12 yrs  \nand beyond)\n\n* Understanding and Identifying Communication Breakdowns  \n* Demonstrating strategies for slow, clear speech in practice scenarios\n\nButton: [Choose Intermediate Level](#intermediate-level:-increasing-mastery-of-strategies)  \n**Advanced Level:**   \n**Correcting Intelligibility Issues in Conversations**  \n(Ages: 10 \\- 12 yrs  \nand beyond)\n\n* Using slow, clear speech strategies in the natural environment as needed\n\nButton: [Choose Advanced Level](#advanced-level:-correcting-intelligibility-issues-in-conversations)\n\n\\<JACK: when they click on one of the buttons above, open the associated section below:\\>\n\n#### Beginner Level: Specific Strategies for Slow, Clear Speech {#beginner-level:-specific-strategies-for-slow,-clear-speech}\n\nIn the first level of therapy for cluttering, we aim to help the individual become aware of their cluttering and to learn how to slow their rate and increase their intelligibility in structured speech tasks.\n\n**Sample Goal:** \n\n1. **Understanding Cluttering:** When prompted, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will provide a brief definition of cluttering (such as \"when you speak too fast and your speech gets hard to understand\") and demonstrate how one can slow down their speech to make it more clear on 2 consecutive data collection days.  \n\n   (\\**Note: speech does not have to be significantly more clear at this stage, we just want them to try to slow it down a little.  The next phases of therapy will specifically target increasing intelligibility.*)\n\n2. **Learning and Practicing Specific Strategies for Slowing Rate and Increasing Intelligibility:**  By the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will practice and demonstrate each of the following cluttering strategies during structured therapy tasks on 80% of observed opportunities:  \n   1. Adding pauses to slow down the perceived rate of speech  \n   2. Over-articulating (or over-exaggerating the pronunciation of speech sounds) in single words, phrases, and sentences, including with multi-syllabic words  \n   3. Over-emphasizing the endings of words in single words, phrases, and sentences  \n   4. Adding emphasis to key words in a sentence by making them louder and longer than other words  \n   5. Maintaining consistent volume through the duration of speech\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, use the suggested activities below:\n\nButton: [Using Slow and Clear Speech for Cluttering](#page-204:-using-slow-and-clear-speech-in-structured-speech-tasks-\\(for-cluttering\\))\n\n#### Intermediate Level: Increasing mastery of strategies {#intermediate-level:-increasing-mastery-of-strategies}\n\nAt this level, the individual will begin to practice using strategies to slow their rate and increase their intelligibility in practice scenarios. They will begin to develop an awareness of how communication breakdowns may occur and what can be done to help repair them.\n\n**Sample Goal:** \n\nBy the end of the reporting period, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will identify at least three signs that a listener does not understand and will demonstrate the use of slow, clear speech strategies in practice scenarios to repair the communication breakdown in 4 out of 5 opportunities.\n\n**Therapy Activities:**  \nTo make progress in this area, use the suggested activities below:\n\nButton: [Using Slow, Clear Speech During Practice Scenarios](#page-205:-using-slow,-clear-speech-during-practice-scenarios-\\(for-cluttering\\))\n\n#### \n\n#### Advanced Level: Correcting Intelligibility Issues in Conversations {#advanced-level:-correcting-intelligibility-issues-in-conversations}\n\nAt this level, individuals learn to self-monitor their own intelligibility and use strategies to slow down and increase intelligibility as needed during conversations throughout the day.\n\n**Sample Goal:** \n\nBy the end of the reporting period, during ten minutes of unstructured conversation in a natural setting, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will use slow, clear speech strategies as needed and achieve a score of 4 or higher on the intelligibility and breakdown repair rubric below, as rated by the speech-language pathologist, on three consecutive data collection days.\n\n**Rubric:**\n\n* **5 \\=** Speech was consistently slow and clear, with almost everything easily understood. If a rare misunderstanding occurred, the student independently slowed down and clarified without prompting.\n\n* **4 \\=** Much of the student’s speech was slow and clear.
