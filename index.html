This pathway is ideal for those who need to reorganize their speech sound system.

This pathway supports those with motor-based speech disorders, such as apraxia.

While the Articulation Curriculum focuses on teaching individual speech sounds, the Phonology Curriculum will teach entire classes of sounds or sound patterns. Individuals with phonological disorders often exhibit predictable error patterns, such as leaving off final consonants or replacing entire groups of sounds with easier ones. These patterns can significantly impact how well they are understood by others.</p>

                <h2>Motor Speech Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Motor speech disorders, such as childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and dysarthria, affect a child's ability to plan, coordinate, and produce speech sounds accurately. Unlike articulation or phonological disorders, which stem from difficulties with specific sounds or patterns, motor speech disorders are rooted in challenges with motor planning, sequencing, and execution of movements needed for clear speech. These difficulties can result in inconsistent speech errors, trouble producing longer words, difficulty transitioning between sounds, and even physical struggle during speech production.</p>

                <h2>Mumbling Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Mumbling occurs when speech is unclear, slurred, or too quiet, making it difficult for others to understand. Children who mumble may drop sounds, speak too quickly, or fail to fully articulate words, often without realizing it. While their speech may technically be correct, the lack of clarity, volume, or articulation can interfere with communication, leading to frustration in academic and social settings.</p>
                <p>Choose the level below that best fits this individual's current level. You don't necessarily need to start at the first level if they have advanced beyond it.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the individual is difficult to understand, speaks very quickly, and is easier to understand when you ask them to slow down, consider the <a href="#page-42:-cluttering-curriculum">Cluttering Curriculum</a> instead.</p>

                    <p>At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping the child become aware of their speech clarity by practicing intentional overarticulation in structured activities. Many children who mumble are unaware that their speech is unclear, so this stage emphasizes exaggerating speech movements, slowing down, and fully pronouncing words to establish a foundation for clear communication. By using overarticulation in structured tasks, the child learns what clear speech feels and sounds like, making it easier to carry over into everyday interactions.</p>

This helps them build self-awareness and control over their speech while still having external support.</p>

                <p>The ability to understand and follow directions is a foundational language skill that impacts a child's ability to function in the classroom, follow routines, and engage in social interactions. Some children struggle with following directions due to difficulty processing language, remembering steps, or understanding key concepts like spatial terms, sequencing, or conditionals. These challenges can lead to frustration, difficulty completing tasks, and reduced independence in academic and everyday situations.</p>

                <p>Being able to sequence and retell events in a clear, logical way is an essential language skill for communication, academic success, and social interactions. Some children struggle with this because they start in the middle of a story, mix up the order of events, leave out key details, or assume the listener already knows the context. These difficulties can make it hard for them to share experiences, explain what happened, or participate in discussions, leading to frustration and misunderstandings.</p>

                <p>A strong vocabulary is essential for effective communication, reading comprehension, and academic success. Some children struggle with vocabulary development due to limited exposure to language, difficulty retaining new words, or challenges understanding word meanings in different contexts. Building vocabulary skills systematically helps children improve their ability to understand and express ideas clearly across various settings.</p>

						<p><b>3 - Developing:</b> Has an expanding vocabulary including around 75-150 words, covering common categories like animals, food, transportation, and emotions. Can describe familiar objects with some detail and uses more than one word to express ideas (e.g., “big red truck” instead of just “truck”). Uses simple sentences but relies on basic, familiar words.</p>
						<p><b>2 - Emerging:</b> Uses 50-75 words, mainly for familiar nouns, verbs, and simple adjectives. Struggles to find precise words and often repeats the same basic vocabulary. Needs prompting to describe objects or explain ideas.</p>
						<p><b>1 - Beginning:</b> Uses fewer than 50 words, mostly relying on common nouns and a few verbs (e.g., "go," "eat"). Struggles to name new objects or actions without direct prompting. Often resorts to gestures or general words like “that” instead of specific vocabulary.</p>

						<p><b>5 - Mastery:</b> Independently applies multiple strategies (morphology, context clues, synonyms/antonyms, multiple meanings) to determine word meaning and provides a well-explained definition using academic language. Can confidently use the word in a sentence and explain how they figured it out.</p>
						<p><b>4 - Proficient:</b> Uses two or more strategies to determine word meaning with minimal support. Can explain their reasoning and use the word in a meaningful sentence, though explanations may lack full academic depth.</p>
						<p><b>3 - Developing:</b> Uses at least one strategy (e.g., breaking the word into parts, using context clues) but needs prompting to apply additional strategies. Provides a general idea of the word’s meaning but may struggle with accurate word use.</p>
						<p><b>2 - Emerging:</b> Recognizes the word as unfamiliar and attempts a strategy (e.g., guessing based on prior knowledge) but needs moderate prompting to apply effective word-learning techniques. Struggles to explain their reasoning.</p>
						<p><b>1 - Beginning:</b> Has difficulty identifying or analyzing new words independently. Needs maximum support to apply strategies and determine meaning. Often guesses without using a structured approach.</p>

                <h2>Language Foundations for Literacy Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Strong language skills are the foundation for successful literacy development. Many children who struggle with reading and writing have underlying language weaknesses that impact their ability to comprehend text, express ideas clearly, and engage in meaningful conversations. This curriculum plays an essential role in supporting the language components of literacy, ensuring children develop the skills they need to understand and use language effectively in reading and writing.</p>
                <p>Choose the level below that best fits this individual's current level. You don't necessarily need to start at the first level if they have advanced beyond it.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the individual has underlying language delays, those should also be addressed to support literacy development. <a href="#selectedLanguage">Click here to identify which language skills the individual needs to work on.</a></p>

                <h2>Cycles Approach for Language Curriculum (Core Language Program)</h2>
                <p>A <strong>cyclical approach</strong> (also called a rotating or cycles approach) is a goal attack strategy where several therapy targets are addressed in succession for fixed intervals, rather than working on one goal until mastery or targeting all goals at once. Fey (1986) defined a cyclical strategy as one in which multiple goals are each targeted for a specified period of time independent of performance accuracy, and then the sequence of goals is repeated.</p>
                <p>The rationale behind a cycles approach is that <strong>individuals often benefit from distributed practice on various skills over time</strong>; even if an individual hasn't mastered a skill before switching to the next, the skill will be revisited in later cycles. This mirrors typical development – children gradually refine multiple language or speech skills in parallel, rather than perfecting one sound or structure before learning another.</p>
                <p><strong>If an individual is struggling in many areas of language, it may be beneficial to try a cyclical approach</strong> to therapy so that you can help them make progress in many areas of language simultaneously. Keep in mind though, if the individual is NOT making progress with this type of an approach, you can always switch back to a more narrow focus on one skill area or Curriculum at a time to ensure progress before moving on.</p>

                <h2>Social Awareness and Interaction Curriculum</h2>
                <p>At Speech and Language Kids, we believe that every child deserves the opportunity to engage with the world in a way that feels authentic and comfortable to them. Social interaction is not about conforming to rigid expectations but about creating meaningful connections in ways that honor each child's unique strengths, communication style, and sensory needs.</p>
                <p>The Social Awareness & Interaction Curriculum is designed to support children in developing skills that help them navigate interactions while respecting their individual preferences. Whether a child prefers verbal, nonverbal, or alternative forms of communication, our approach ensures that they are empowered to engage in ways that feel safe and natural to them.</p>

                <h2>Stuttering Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Stuttering is a speech pattern characterized by disruptions to the smoothness and flow of speech, such as through repetitions (b-b-ball), prolongations (ssssun), or blocks (—dog). The Stuttering Therapy Curriculum provides a structured approach to supporting individuals who stutter by providing them with strategies to reduce moments of stuttering and help individuals move through those moments more easily.</p>
