üö® CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT

SLK Curriculum Planning Tool - A comprehensive web application for speech-language therapy curriculum planning. This is a single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This project has content accuracy issues that MUST be fixed.

üéØ PRIMARY MISSION

CONTENT VERIFICATION & REPOSITORY CLEANUP

üéØ REMEMBER

You are working with a client's content. Accuracy is CRITICAL.

Think of yourself as a "fast intern with perfect memory" - capable but needs supervision.

Always verify your work. Always wait for permission. Always quote exact text.

The goal is 100% content accuracy and a clean, maintainable codebase.
