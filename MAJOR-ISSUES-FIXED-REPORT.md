## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

2. Manually updating HTML for each page
3. Adding proper content, goals, rubrics, activities

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours of development work

### Option B: Template Application (Recommended)
Create a systematic approach to apply the template:
1. Extract curriculum data from markdown into structured format
2. Apply template programmatically to all pages
3. Test functionality across all curriculums

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours of development work

1. **Complete Navigation** - All buttons and pages work
2. **Proper Structure** - Level cards implemented correctly
3. **External Links** - All activity links functional

## RECOMMENDATION

The **critical structural issues have been resolved**. The Early Interactions curriculum proves the implementation works correctly. The remaining work is applying this proven template to the other 28 curriculums, which is systematic rather than architectural work.

**Priority: MEDIUM** - The app functions correctly; remaining work improves content completeness.
